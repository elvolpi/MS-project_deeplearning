# MS-project_deeplearning
Repository for MS of Statistics Project "Diving Into the Deep End of Machine Learning: Using Keras for Predicting Educational Outcomes with Tabular Data"

My data is from MIDFIELD, website: https://midfield.online/ ,  github is here: https://github.com/MIDFIELDR/midfieldr

We will build two keras  to predict whether a student will graduate as a STEM grad, lower_div_courses and student_terms. We also compare their results to a binary classification glm. For details on this project, please see the presentation slides.
